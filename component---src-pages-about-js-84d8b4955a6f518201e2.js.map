I have been working in the technology industry since 2016, and during that time I had the experience of developing things in Javascript, mostly web and mobile applications.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I was born in the interior of Para√≠ba and then went to live in a place called Tacaratu, in the interior of Pernambuco, where I spent a lot of time studying and started to dream of creating my first codes and through them to build a life different from the one I knew. For me, technology was a gift because, thanks to it, I was able to access the great world repository of knowledge, the Internet, and through it I got to know a new world, where I could be who I was and still start to develop my skills to build a career.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I believe that knowledge is the most empowering thing that we can share in the community. Just as technology was a gift that changed my life, I believe it can make a difference in other people's lives, so I love creating connections to share knowledge.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I really like to share the things I learn, and I did it most of my time working as a teacher in an education program in advanced digital technologies that takes place in favelas in Rio de Janeiro called VaiNaWeb.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I also had the opportunity to make many significant exchanges of knowledge in some other code communities created to support underrepresented groups in technology, such as PyLadies, Django Girls and ReactLadies.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"about-gallery\">\n          <img className=\"image-about\" src={image03}/>\n          <img className=\"image-about\" src={image09}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"about-gallery\">\n          <img className=\"image-about\" src={image08}/>\n          <img className=\"image-about\" src={image07}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"about-gallery\">\n          <img className=\"image-about\" src={image06}/>\n          <img className=\"image-about\" src={image05}/>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        author\n      }\n    }\n    allMarkdownRemark(\n      sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }\n      filter: { frontmatter: { published: { eq: true } } }\n    ) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          excerpt\n          fields {\n            slug\n          }\n          timeToRead\n          frontmatter {\n            shortDate: date(formatString: \"MMMM DD, YYYY\")\n            longDate: date(formatString: \"MMMM DD, YYYY, h:mm:ss a\")\n            title\n            description\n            categories\n            cover {\n              childImageSharp {\n                fluid(maxWidth: 1200) {\n                  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n\nexport default AboutPage;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/06-ce0592dc1abb662724c85b1f01e878f0.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/07-b3dbaf6460d50c56c01f669c24139097.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/me-92d27b699dbdf7fb2706b9f032c4d9e4.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/03-1d5abd590faf47f128526eb7fb8e14ee.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/08-664c97e1867e6d1905dd82b08e4ddce1.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/05-5a8cd0126181fe372d2f08b94e78483d.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/09-24703490ee8594d32ee7a6ccce46f0a1.jpeg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
