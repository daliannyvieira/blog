I have been working in the technology industry since 2016, and during that time I had the experience of developing things in Javascript, mostly web and mobile applications. </p>\n        \n        <p>\n          I was born in the interior of Para√≠ba and then went to live in a place called Tacaratu, in the interior of Pernambuco, where I spent a lot of time studying and started to dream of creating my first codes and through them to build a life different from the one I knew. For me, technology was a gift because, thanks to it, I was able to access the great world repository of knowledge, the Internet, and through it I got to know a new world, where I could be who I was and still start\n          to develop my skills to build a career.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"about-gallery\">\n          <img className=\"image-about\" src={image01} alt=\"I'm smiling\" />\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          Personally I believe that knowledge is the most empowering thing that we can share in the community.
